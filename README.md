* How to manage Docker images and containers
* How to "Dockerize" an existing web application (we'll use NodeJS applications as examples)
* Running multiple containers with Docker Compose
* Using Docker for local development
* Deploy Docker on a variety of cloud providers, including Heroku, Now.sh, and Amazon EC2 Container Service (ECS)
